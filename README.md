# Malaria-matching-algorithm
The R package developed to analyse the dataset in the paper detailed below, the dataset is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. This is my personal code that I wrote for my own use and is not intended to provide a general method for matching blood meals found in mosquitoes to human blood samples. If you have any questions about how the code works please contact me at j.hellewell14@imperial.ac.uk
